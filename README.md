## ✨ My Coding Journey & Inspiration

My journey into the captivating world of web development began at Florintech Computer College. It was there, amidst lines of code and the glow of monitors, that I discovered my passion for crafting digital experiences from the ground up.  I transitioned from a complete novice to a builder of responsive, full-stack websites, an achievement that fueled my desire to learn and create even more.

What truly drives me is the **artistry** of creating **captivating** web applications.  I am inspired by the endless possibilities that code offers to solve real-world problems and to bring innovative ideas to life. Just as in fitness, where consistent effort yields visible progress and strength, I find coding to be a discipline where persistent learning and practice sculpt elegant and powerful solutions. The satisfaction of seeing a project come together, piece by piece, is my constant motivation.
